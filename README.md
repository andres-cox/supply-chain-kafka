1. Microservices Architecture
Microservice	Responsibility	Input Topics (Consumes)	Output Topics (Produces)
Order Service	Creates shipments, validates orders	-	shipment-created
Tracking Service	Updates real-time location (GPS/API)	shipment-created	location-updates
Warehouse Service	Manages inventory, triggers restocks	inventory-low (from DB)	restock-requested
Customer Portal	Displays shipment status to users	location-updates	-
Fraud Detection	Analyzes routes for anomalies	shipment-created, location-updates	fraud-alerts
Notification Service	Sends emails/SMS for delays/completions	fraud-alerts, location-updates	-
Total Microservices: 6
Minikube Viability: Yes (Minikube can handle this if allocated 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM).

Each service can run as a single replica for development.

Use kubectl autoscale for CPU-based scaling if needed.

2. Kafka Cluster Setup
Brokers & Topics
Component	Recommendation	Notes
Kafka Brokers	2 brokers (1 leader, 1 follower)	Minikube can handle 2 brokers with persistence enabled.
ZooKeeper	1 node (embedded with Kafka Helm chart)	No need for separate ZooKeeper cluster in dev.
Topics	5 topics (all with replication=2, partitions=3):
- shipment-created
- location-updates
- inventory-low
- fraud-alerts
- restock-requested	Partitioning enables parallel processing.
Topic Configuration
bash
Copy
# Example topic creation (run in Kafka pod)
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --bootstrap-server kafka-0.kafka-headless:9092 \
  --topic shipment-created \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 2
3. Minikube Resource Allocation
Start Minikube with:

bash
Copy
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192 --driver=docker
Helm/Kafka Setup:

bash
Copy
helm install kafka bitnami/kafka \
  --set replicaCount=2 \
  --set persistence.enabled=true \
  --set persistence.size=5Gi
Each broker gets 1 CPU, 2GB RAM (adjustable via resources in Helm).

4. Data Flow & Scaling
Scenario: Shipment from Warehouse to Customer
Order Service â†’ Publishes to shipment-created (e.g., {"shipment_id": "123", "route": ["A", "B", "C"]}).

Tracking Service:

Consumes shipment-created, starts polling GPS.

Publishes location-updates every 5 mins (e.g., {"shipment_id": "123", "lat": 12.34, "lon": 56.78}).

Fraud Detection:

Compares actual route (location-updates) vs. planned route (shipment-created).

Publishes fraud-alerts if deviation > 10km.

Customer Portal:

Subscribes to location-updates, shows real-time map.

Scaling Needs:
High Throughput: Scale Tracking Service pods if GPS updates are frequent.

Heavy Processing: Scale Fraud Detection pods if complex ML models are used.

5. Key Technical Considerations
Aspect	Recommendation
Persistence	Enable Kafka persistence (5Gi per broker) to survive Minikube restarts.
Consumer Groups	Use separate groups per service (e.g., fraud-detection-group).
Message Format	Use Avro (with Schema Registry) for contract enforcement.
Error Handling	Dead-letter topics (e.g., dlq-location-updates) for failed messages.
Monitoring	Prometheus + Grafana (use kafka-exporter for metrics).
6. Minikube Limitations & Workarounds
Limitation	Workaround
Limited Resources	Reduce broker replicas to 1 if CPU/memory is tight.
No Load Balancer	Use NodePort or kubectl port-forward for local testing.
Single Node	Not ideal for testing Kafka failovers; mock failures with kubectl delete pod.

8. When to Move Beyond Minikube
If: You need >3 brokers, 10+ microservices, or production-grade resilience.

Then: Switch to EKS/AKS/GKE or a managed Kafka service (Confluent Cloud).

This setup gives you a realistic, scalable logistics system on Minikube. Want to dive deeper into any component (e.g., fraud detection logic)? Let me know! ðŸš›ðŸ“¦
